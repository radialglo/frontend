JavaScript Practice
========

After working with jQuery and advanced JavaScript concepts such as **Document Fragments**, **closures** and **OO JavaScript**, I'm revisiting native JavaScript and reviewing events, DOM, Navigator, && Window objects, etc. It's pretty cool(well, it's expected) to see a lot of similarities between the jQuery and JavaScript syntax. The motivation for  the introduction of .on() and .off() functions in jQuery 1.7+ to replace .live(), .delegate(), .bind() for attaching events seems pretty clear now :)
